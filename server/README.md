start the server: npm run dev
seed the db: npm run seed
test all files: npm test
test-watch one test file: npm run test-watch filename
(doesnt have to be the exact path, jest will find tests that match what you input
ex: npm run test-watch swapChore will look for a test with swapChore in its filename)
